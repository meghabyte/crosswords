This repository contains all logs (json) and visualizations (html) for the crossword solving task from the paper [Evaluating Human-Language Model Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09746), where crowdworkers try to solve a crossword puzzle under 30 minutes with unrestricted help from an "AI Teammate" based on an underlying language model (LM).
